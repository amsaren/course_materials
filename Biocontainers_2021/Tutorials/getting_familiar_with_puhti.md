# Getting familiar with Puhti

The main purpose of this tutorial is to get familar wit working in CSC
Puhti supercomputer. 

Some exercises are done in interactive mode using the [sinteractive](https://docs.csc.fi/computing/running/interactive-usage/) 
command and some as batch jobs.

## Interactive: Retrieving data from bio repositories

> These exercises cover retrieving data from various commonly used bio data repositories.

- We will do these exercises using the [sinteractive](https://docs.csc.fi/computing/running/interactive-usage/) command (substitute xxxx with correct project number):
```text
sinteractive --account project_xxxx
```
- To use the applications in steps 2 and 3, we will need to load the biokit module:
```text
module load biokit
```
- Move to `/scratch` directory area of the course project (unless there already):
```text
cd /scratch/project_xxxx  # substitute xxxx with correct project number
```
- Create a directory for yourself and move to it (unless there already):
```text
mkdir $USER
cd $USER
```

ðŸ’­ Everyone in the project shares the same `/scratch` directory, so
it is a good idea to use subdirectories for each user and task, so 
you won't accidentally delete or overwrite each others files.

ðŸ—¯ In normal usage it may be a good idea to even use `chmod` command 
to alter file access rights so that only you have write access to
your own subfolder, but please do not do this in the course project, 
as it would make clean-up after course harder.

- You can find more information about this in [Disk areas](https://docs.csc.fi/computing/disk/)
page in the Docs.

### 1. Downloading data with curl

- `curl` and `wget` are general tools to download data from an URL.

- Download a dataset from internet using `curl` and uncompress it. The dataset contains some *Pythium* genomes with  related BWA indexes.
```text
curl https://a3s.fi/course_12.11.2019/pythium.tgz > pythium.tgz
ls -ltr
tar -zxvf pythium.tgz  
ls -ltr
```

### 2. Downloading data with NCBI edirect

- Create directory `cellulose_synthase` and move to this new directory:
```text
mkdir cellulose_synthase
cd cellulose_synthase
```
- Next we use [NCBI edirect tool](https://docs.csc.fi/apps/edirect/) to retrieve some data.

- Check how many proteins are found the NCBI protein databanks for *Pythium* species (`count` row in the results):
```text
esearch -db protein -query "Pythium [ORGN]" 
```
- Then check the number of proteins: **cellulose synthase 1**, **cellulose synthase 2** and **cellulose synthase 3** that are found for *Pythium* species.

- For cellulose synthase 1 this can be done with:
```text
esearch -db protein -query "Pythium [ORGN] AND cellulose synthase 1 [PROT]"
```
- Do the same for the other proteins.

- Retrive the cellulose synthase 3 sequenses in Fasta format
```text
esearch -db protein -query "Pythium [ORGN] AND cellulose synthase 3 [PROT]" | efetch -format fasta > cesy3.fasta
```
- Then run `esearch` command that tells how many **cellulose synthase 3** sequences there are in total in the NCBI protein database?

### 3. Downloading with enaDataGet

- Check the options of enaDataGet with command:
```text
enaDataGet -h
```
- Download a file (Pythium iwayamai  genome assembly)
```text
enaDataGet AKYA02000000 -f fasta
gunzip AKYA02.fasta.gz 
ls -ltr
```

## Batch jobs: Align the cellulose synthase 3 set with mafft



```text
mafft cesy3.fasta > cesy3_aln.fasta
```
- And study the results:
```text
infoalign cesy3_aln.fasta
showalign cesy3_aln.fasta
```

### Extra exercise for the fast ones: study the downloaded file:
```text
head -20 AKYA02.fasta
tail AKYA02.fasta
infoseq_summary  AKYA02.fasta
```
- Then compare the cellulose synthase 3 sequences against the genome using BLAST
```text
pb tblastn -query cesy3.fasta -dbnuc AKYA02.fasta -out blast_result.txt
```
