# Singularity tutorial part 2

## Using files
üí¨ Singularity containers have their own internal file system that is separate from the host file system. 
- The internal file system is always read-only when the container is run with normal user rights.

üí≠ In most real-world use cases you probably want to access the host file system to read and write files. 
- To do this you must bind a writable directory on host file system to the internal file system of the container. 

üí° This is done with command line argument `--bind` (or `-B`). The basic syntax is 
`--bind /path/in/host:/path/inside/container`.

üí≠ Some remarks:  
‚ûñ The bind path does not need to exist inside the container ‚Äì it is created if necessary.  
‚ûñ More than one bind pair can be specified.  
‚ûñ The option is available for all the run methods described in the previous tutorial.  

1. To run these exercises in Puhti, use `sinteractive`:
    ```bash
    sinteractive --account project_xxxx   # Change the xxxx for the project number
    ```
2. Try listing the contents of your project directory (substitute the correct path) from inside the container without `bind`:
    ```bash
    export SCRATCH=/scratch/project_xxxx/yourcscusername    # Replace xxxx and yourcscusername
    singularity exec tutorial.sif ls $SCRATCH
    ```
3. The container can not see the host directory, so you will get a "No such file or directory" error.
4. Now try binding host directory `/scratch` to directory `/scratch` inside the container:
    ```bash
    singularity exec --bind $SCRATCH:/scratch tutorial.sif ls /scratch
    ```
    - Or:
    ```bash
    singularity exec --bind /scratch:/scratch tutorial.sif ls $SCRATCH
    ```
5. This time the host directory is linked to to the container directory and the command shows what the container sees inside `/scratch`.

üí° You can use `bind`to set the container, for example, to find input data or configuration files from a certain directory.

6. Bind host directory specified in `$SCRATCH` into directory `/input`:
```bash
singularity exec --bind $SCRATCH:/input tutorial.sif ls /input
```

### Using the singularity wrapper
1. If you use wrapper script `singularity_wrapper`, it will take care of the binds for most common use cases:
    ```bash
    singularity_wrapper exec tutorial.sif ls $SCRATCH
    ```
2. If environment variable `$SING_IMAGE` is set, you don't even need to provide path to the image file:
    ```bash
    export SING_IMAGE=$PWD/tutorial.sif
    singularity_wrapper exec ls $SCRATCH
    ```

‚ÄºÔ∏è Since some modules set `$SING_IMAGE` when loaded, it is a good idea to start with `module purge` or `unset SING_IMAGE`
if you plan to use it, to make sure correct image is used.

## Environment variables
üí¨ Some software may reguire some environment variables to be set, e.g. to point to some reference data or a configuration file.

üí¨ Most environment variables set on the host are inherited by the container. 
- Sometimes this may be undesirable. 
- With command line option `--cleanenv` host environment is not inherited by the container.

üí¨ To set an environment variable specifically inside the container, you can set an environment variable `$SINGULARITYENV_xxx` (where xxx is the variable name) on the host before invoking the container.

1. Set some test variables:
    ```bash
    export TEST1="value1"
    export SINGULARITYENV_TEST2="value2"
    ```
2. Compare the outputs of:
    ```bash
    env |grep TEST
    singularity exec tutorial.sif env |grep TEST
    singularity exec --cleanenv tutorial.sif env |grep TEST
    ```
    - The first command is run on host, and we see `$TEST1` and `$SINGULARITYENV_TEST2`. 
    - The second command is run in the container and we see `$TEST1` (inherited from host) and `$TEST2` (specifically set inside the container by setting `$SINGULARITYENV_TEST2` on host). 
    - The third command is also run  inside the container, but this time we omitted host environment variables, so we only see `$TEST2`.
3. Note that any variables on command line are substituted by their values on the host:
    ```bash
    singularity exec tutorial.sif echo $TEST1
    singularity exec tutorial.sif echo $TEST2
    ```
    - The first line prints the value set in the host
    - The second line will result in empty output because a variable called `$TEST2` has not been set on host. (It was `SINGULARITYENV_TEST2="value2"` remember?)

## Exploring containers

üí¨ Our test container includes program `hello2`, but it is not in the `$PATH`. 

1. One way to find it is to try running `find` inside the container:
    ```bash
    singularity exec tutorial.sif find / -type f -name "hello2" 2>/dev/null
    ```
2. You can now run it by providing the full path:
    ```bash
    singularity exec tutorial.sif /found/me/hello2
    ```
3. Or you could add it to `$PATH` inside the container:
    ```bash
    export SINGULARITYENV_PREPEND_PATH=/found/me
    singularity exec tutorial.sif hello2
    ```

üí° If you can't locate the desired binary with `find`, you can always use `singularity shell` to explore the container.

## Running Singularity as a batch job
üí° `Singularity exec` is the run method you will typically use in a batch job script.

1. Make a file called `test.sh`:
    ```bash
    module load nano   # The computing node does not have nano by default
    nano test.sh
    ```
2. Copy the following contents into the file and change "project_xxxx" to the correct project name:
    ```bash
   #!/bin/bash
   #SBATCH --job-name=test           # Name of the job visible in the queue.
   #SBATCH --account=project_xxxx    # Choose the billing project. Has to be defined!
   #SBATCH --partition=test          # Job queues: test, interactive, small, large, longrun, hugemem, hugemem_longrun
   #SBATCH --time=00:01:00           # Maximum duration of the job. Max: depends of the partition. 
   #SBATCH --mem=1G                  # How much RAM is reserved for job per node.
   #SBATCH --ntasks=1                # Number of tasks. Max: depends on partition.
   #SBATCH --cpus-per-task=1         # How many processors work on one task. Max: Number of CPUs per node.

   singularity exec tutorial.sif hello_world
    ```
3. Submit the job to the queue with:
    ```bash
   sbatch test.sh
    ```
