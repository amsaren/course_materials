# Creating singularity containers from definition files

In this tutorial we create a Singularity container from a definition file.

There are many ways to build Singularity containers. While writing and using definition files 
many not be the most intuitive one, it has many benefits: Definition files are easily 
upgradeabla and reusable. They are the prefereable way to to distribute containers (as opposed
to "black box" image files) and are necessary when uploadin your images to most repositories.

In most cases it is preferable to build containers in a system where you have root access.
This could be your own machine or a suitable virtual machine. This kind of setup gives you 
the most options, and makes troubleshooting the easiest.

In this tutorial, however, we will be using the [Sylabs Remote Builder](https://cloud.sylabs.io/builder) 
service instead. This way of building has some limitations, but can be run without root 
access on host system, as long as you can log into the Sylabs service.

We will be building a container for [MACS3](https://github.com/macs3-project/MACS) software.


## Preliminaries

Go to SyLabs [Singularity Container Services](https://cloud.sylabs.io/home) page and sign in.
You should be able to use your Google, GitHub, GitLab or Microsoft account to log in.

Go to [Account Management](https://cloud.sylabs.io/auth) and create a new Access Token.

Save the token, as we will need it later in the tutorial, and it can not be displayed again
once you close the browser window.


## Create a definition file

Log into Puhti.

Create an empty definition file. You can use a text editor of your choice, e.g. `nano`:
```bash
nano macs3.def
```
ðŸ’¬ In nano you can use `ctrl + o` to save and `ctrl + x` to exit.

A definition file will have a header defining the base image, and number of sections defining
different aspects of the container. All sections are optional. We will discuss some of the most 
used options here. Please see the [Singularity documentation](https://sylabs.io/guides/3.8/user-guide/definition_files.html) 
for a full list and detailed descriptions.


### Selecting the base image

You typically start by selecting a suitable base image. This will have the basic operating system,
file system etc for your image. These can be selected from e.g Singularity conatiner library, Docker 
Hub or Singularity Hub. The possible sources and options are discussed in more detail in the lecture.

Selection of base image depends on the software. If, for example, the software developer provide 
installation instructions for a certain version of Ubuntu, it's probably easiest to start with that.

If you plan to build an image with MPI support, it is easiesto start with something close to the host 
system. In case of Puhti this would be CentOs 7.

In this case we are installing a Python software, so choice of operating systems is not that critical. 
In this case we'll start with Ubuntu 20.04 definition from Docker Hub.

Add the following lines to the definition file:

```text
Bootstrap: docker
From: ubuntu: 20.04
```

### Including files

When building an image on a local computer, you can include files form host file system. These are defined
in the `%files` section. The format is `/path/in/host /path/in/container`, so to include file `myfile.txt`
from the current directory to directory `/some/path` inside the container, you would add:
```text
%files

  myfile.txt /some/path/myfile.txt
```
When using Remote Builder this won't work (local files are not available at the remote build server), so if 
you need to include files make them available from net and download the from inside the container using 
`git`, `wget`, `curl` or similar in the `%post` section. 

ðŸ’¬These tools are often not included in the base image, so you will need to install them first.

It is a good practise to do this anyway if you plan on distributing the container, as this way other people can 
build the container without needing files only available in your system.

MACS3 does not need any extra files, so in this case we can just omit the whole section.


### Installing software

All commands that should be run inside the container after the base image is running, are included in section `%post`.
These typically including all installation commands.

As these commands are executed inside the container, we usually have access to package manager softwares for each 
distribution, e.g. `apt` for Ubunbtu (depends on the base image used). All commands are executed with root rights by 
default, so there is no need to prefix the commands with `sudo`.

Many base images are very barebones to keep the images small. For example you often have to start by installing the 
compiler environment, file transfer tools and other tools you may need. A packet manager is usually included.

The base image we chose does not include Python, so we will start by installing it. It does include packet manager `apt`,
so we can use it to install Python. 

Add the following lines to the definition file:

```text
%post

  # Install python
  apt update
  apt install python3 -y
  apt install pip -y
  ln -s /usr/bin/python3 /usr/bin/python
```
ðŸ’¬Indentation is optional, but improves readability. 
ðŸ’¬Comments will make the definition file easier to read for others (and also for yourself after some time has passed).

Easiest way to install MACS3 in by using Pypi:
```text
  # Install MACS3
  pip install MACS3
```

Since MACS3 is still under development, we might prefer to install from source instead. For this we also need to 
install git and python3-devel packages.
```text
  # Install MACS3
  apt install python3-devel -y
  apt install git -y
  git clone https://github.com/macs3-project/MACS.git -recurse-submodules
  cd MACS
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  python setup.py install
```

### Setting up the environment

Any commands that set up the environment go to the `%environment` section.

The default `$PATH` for a Singularity environment is
```text
/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin
```

Since we have root access inside the container, we can usually install to default system locations, and
thus don't need to adjust the environment. Sometimes however, especially when using Conda or some software 
specific installations scripts, the installation may end up in some other location.

For example if we choose to install MACS3 in non-standard location in the last section:

```text
python setup.py install --prefix=/app/macs
```

We would need to adjust `$PATH` and `$PYTHONPATH`:
```text
%environment

  export PATH=/app/macs/bin:$PATH
  export PYTHONPATH=/app/macs/lib/python3.8/site-packages
```
ðŸ’¬These can also be set at runtime in the host system, but it's more user friendly to set them in container.

In the finished container image these commands are stored in script `/environment`.


### Adding a runscript

Runscript is a list of commands that will be executed when the container is run with `singularity run` or when the container 
is run as an executable. It is defined in section `%runscript`.

In the finished container image these commands are stored in script `/singularity`.

For containers that run a service, e.g. a web server or similar, the runscript usually starts the service.

For application containers, like the MACS3 container we are building, it's up to the author to decide what to put here. One option is to make
the container run any command line options as a command. This will make `singularity run` behave similarily to `singularity exec`.

```tetx
%runscript

  exec "$@"
```
ðŸ’¬In a HPC system, especially with batch jobs, it's best to always use `singularity exec` to run.

The runscript of an existeing container can be checked with:
```bash
singularity inspect --runscript macs3.sif
```

### Adding information about the container

Singularity automatically add some metadata to the container. This includes Singularity version number, build date, base 
image etc. If you wish to add some additional metadata, e.g your contact information, you do it in section `%labels`. This 
is advisable, especially if you wish to distribute the container.

```text
%labels

  Maintainer my.address@example.net
  Version v1.0
```
This information can be checked with command:
```bash
singularity inspect --labels macs3.sif
```

It is also possible to add usage information. This goes to section `%help` and can be viewed with
command:
```bash
singularity run-help macs3.sif
```

```text
%help

  This is a container for MACS3 software
  https://github.com/macs3-project/MACS
  MACS3 is distributed under BSD 3-Clause License
  Usage:
  singularity exec macs3.sif macs3 --help
```

## Building the image

Once we have completed our definition file we can build the container image.

The basic command to use on a system where you have root access is:
```bash
sudo singularity build macs3.sif macs3.def
```
This will not work on Puhti, so we will use [Sylabs Remote Builder](https://cloud.sylabs.io/builder) 
service.

You will first need to log in: 
```bash
singularity remote login
```
Paste the access token you created earlier and press `enter`.

ðŸ’¬The Access token is saved in `$HOME/.singularity/remote.yaml`. Login is valid as long as the file exists and 
the Access Token is valid, so you don't need to login every time.

The build command is as above, but we omit `sudo` and add option `--remote`.
```bash
singularity build --remote macs3.sif macs3.def
```
Alternatively you can upload or paste the definition file to the web interface at Sylabs,
and then use `singularity pull` to download the image.
